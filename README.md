Simple python script to download and filter the pdf files from the jfk document release. 
The initial version requires the user to create an "xx.txt" file with the pdf filenames in
the first column. The URL to find the files in the government archive is in the python code as variable 
"DOCS_URL". The user needs to update it to the correct path when needed.
